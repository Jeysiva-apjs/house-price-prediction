# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts house prices using a machine learning model trained on historical housing data. The model utilizes various features such as location, size, and amenities to estimate property prices.

## Project Workflow
The following steps were performed to build the prediction model:

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data inconsistencies.
2. **Data Analysis** – Explored data distribution, correlations, and patterns using statistical and visualization techniques.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Encoded categorical variables, normalized numerical features, and split the dataset.
4. **Data Transformation** – Applied feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
5. **Model Training & Testing** – Used a **Linear Regression** model to train and evaluate the performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data handling and processing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning model implementation)

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script to train and test the model:
```bash
python house_price_prediction.py
```

## Results
The trained Linear Regression model provides insights into house price trends and predictions based on input features.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
- Incorporate more real-world data for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application for user interaction.
